These are helper programs:

- `bgi_palette.png` is a screenshot taken from Turbo C 2.01 running in
  DosBox. The `bgi_orig_palette` palette uses colours picked up from this
  file.

- `chrwidth.c` dumps the width of each character in all fonts.

- `dumpchar.c` is used to dump VGA characters used by Turbo C 2.01 in
  DosBox.

- `truncate.c` shows a bug in Turbo C 2.01; text is not truncated out
  of the viewport as it should be. This bug is fixed in Turbo C++ 3.

- `*.CHR` are original Borland fonts, available from
  <https://github.com/ananay/turboc/tree/master/TC/BGI>
  Copy them to test/ to make them available to test programs.
